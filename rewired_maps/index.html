    <title>System Shock: Rewired Maps</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    These maps are generated from the Rewired ARCHIVE.DAT file using <a href="https://github.com/toxicfrog/ss1edit">ss1edit</a>. Use the controls on the left to select which object types to display and switch levels; mouse over the map for information on map tiles and objects. Use the search bar on the right to find objects by name. Mouse over a search result to hilight it on the map and show the corresponding object information; click on one to switch to the map that contains it.
    <p>
    The map itself is 1024x1024, and the controls on either side of it add some width. You will probably want at least at 1680x1050 display to use it comfortably.
