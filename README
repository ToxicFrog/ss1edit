One day, this is planned to be a full set of editing tools for System Shock - a map and gamesys editor, and converters between SS1 art formats to standard formats that can be edited with existing tools.

At the moment, however, it consists of two tools: `res`, for unpacking (and, eventually, packing) resource files, and `map` for generating pretty HTML5 maps of System Shock levels. Run them without arguments for help. It depends on vstruct[1] and kineticJS[2]. A recent version of kineticJS is included as `kinetic.js`; you'll need to put this in the same directory as the generated map files for them to work.

The generated maps have gotten too large to reasonably commit, so they aren't committed anymore; you can find them at http://funkyhorror.ancilla.ca/toxicfrog/ss1/maps/

Note that unpacking compressed resource files - especially ARCHIVE.DAT, which contains several megabytes of compressed data - is *slow*. It is highly recommended that you create an uncompressed version of ARCHIVE.DAT; the included Makefile will do this automatically, or you can do it yourself using the `res d` command.
