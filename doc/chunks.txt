# Chunk Index

This is an (incomplete) index of all chunks, by chunk ID. It is useful in looking up what a given ID is used for, or for figuring out which IDs are used for a given purpose without looking through all the more specific files.

Chunk IDs are given in decimal because that's what LGS mostly seemed to work with (e.g. level chunk IDs repeat in groups of 1000 rather than groups of 0x400).

## Strings

      36  Long object names
          Each name is stored in the subchunk with index equal to the
          index of the corresponding definition in the gamesys.
          So, the riot gun is at index 4, and the Skorpion at 6.
    2154  Texture names
    2155  "Can't use ____" messages for each texture
    2157  Short object names (see chunk 36)

## Maps & save data

See map.txt for detailed information about which chunks hold what data in maps.

    4000  Save file name (unknown data in ARCHIVE.DAT)
    4001  Player information (in save files)
    40xx  Deck R level map
    4Lxx  Decks 1-9 (L=deck number)
    50xx  SHODAN cyberspace
    5Lxx  Delta, Alpha, and Beta Groves (L=1-3)
    54xx  Deck 1/2 cyberspace
    55xx  Other cyberspace
